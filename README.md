## Overview
Amazon Vine program is a member-based service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews of their products. Part of the Challenge is to compare and analyze reviews from both Vine and non-Vine buyers and to test if there are biased involved. 
Big Data Applications: Create an ETL in cloud using AWS RDS S3, Python PySpark, Google Colab Notebooks, Postgres SQL
I chose to review the ‘Furniture’ category 

## Results:

There was a big gap among the number of reviewers non Vine  18,002 versus Vine members 136 but the variance who gave 5-star 7%  which I believe is unbiased. 
Though reviews may be one of the factors we might consider in quantifying the business for online shopping but there are also other avenues to gauge them such as number of returns/Sales, no of views/hits ot total sales

## Challenges
I’m very anxious and conscious about the AWS usage as I’m hearing a lot that it may charge if you go beyond the capacity
